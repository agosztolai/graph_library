## Hyperbolic-Graph-Generator


The Hyperbolic-Graph-Generator is a package of tools to generate
graphs embedded in the hyperbolic plane, and to compute the efficiency
of greedy forwarding in these graphs.

More details on the graph models implemented in the package are available
at http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05180/.

This standalone package is also a core component of the hyperbolic
routing package that is going to be integrated into the NDNSim (http://ndnsim.net).
Hyperbolic routing is greedy geometric routing in a
hyperbolically embedded network. Hyperbolic routing has attractive
scalability and efficiency characteristics. In particular, applied to
the AS Internet, hyperbolic routing is nearly optimal, i.e., maximally
scalable (http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms1063). The NDN testbed has
been recently mapped to the hyperbolic plane yielding similar routing
efficiency (http://www.caida.org/research/routing/greedy_forwarding_ndn/).
Because of its exceptional scalability and efficiency characteristics,
hyperbolic routing is one of the routing strategies in the NDN
architecture.

### Description:

#### **hyperbolic_graph_generator**

A tool to generate synthetic graphs embedded into a hyperbolic space.

```
NAME: 
hyperbolic_graph_generator -- generate an hyperbolic graph compatible with user parameters 

SYNOPSIS: 
hyperbolic_graph_generator [parameters]  

DESCRIPTION:
The program generates a file (graph.hg is the default file name) that
describes the geometric coordinates and the links of a hyperbolic graph
compatible with the parameters provided by the user. The program generates
random hyperbolic graphs according to the models in:
http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.82.036106
A description of how the hyperbolic graph generator works can be found at:
http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05180

PARAMETERS:
-n	graph size (number of nodes)
        default value is 1000
-k	expected average degree
        default value is 10
-g	expected power-law exponent gamma
        default value is 2 (infinite gamma = 10)
-t	temperature
        default value is 0 (infinite temperature = 10)
-z	square root of curvature zeta=sqrt(-K)
        or ratio eta=zeta/T in Soft Configuration Model
        default value is 1
-s	random seed
        default value is 1
-o	output folder
        default value is current folder
-f	graph file name
        default value is graph (.hg extension is always added)
-h	print help menu
-q	quiet (no information print on standard output)

OUTPUT:
The program generates a file (./graph.hg unless the -o or -f options are turned on)
that lists the coordinates of each node in the hyperbolic space as well as the 
adjacency list. The file format is the following:

# The first line describes the main graph parameters:
N <num nodes> T <temperature> G <gamma> K <avg.degree> Z <zeta> S <seed> I <initial_node_id>

# A line for each node and its polar coordinates:
<node_id>	<radial coordinate>	<angular coordinate>

# A line for each link:
<node_id>	<node id> 

Example:
N	100	T	0	G	2	K	10	Z	2	S	1    I  1
1	0.000301382	0.826476
2	0.093611	2.88178
3	0.0786131	1.37576
... 
99	0.10503	3.97561
100	0.0713906	5.18173
1	2
1	3
1	4
...
97	98
98	99

EXAMPLE:

# Generate a graph of 10,000 nodes with average degree 10,
# whose degrees follow a power-law distribution P(k) ~ k^{-2.5}
# The graph is written in graph_example.hg
# All other parameters take default values

hyperbolic_graph_generator -n 10000 -k 10 -g 2.5 -f graph_example

```


#### **graph_properties**
A tool to compute some basic graph properties of the generated hyperbolic graphs.

```
NAME: 
graph_properties -- compute properties of hyperbolic graphs

SYNOPSIS: 
graph_properties [parameters] 

DESCRIPTION:
The program computes some graph  properties associated with nodes of the
hyperbolic graph provided as input (./graph.hg is default), in detail: 
the polar coordinates of each node, its degree, its average neighbor
degree, and its clustering coefficient.

PARAMETERS:
-i	   graph file (in hg format)
       default value is ./graph.hg
-o   output folder
       default value is current folder
-h   print help menu

OUTPUT:
The program generates five text files having the following format:

radial.txt
    <node id> <radial coordinate>
angular.txt
    <node id> <angular coordinate>
degree.txt
    <node id> <node degree>
knn.txt
    <node id> <node avg. neigh. degree>
cc.txt
    <node id> <node clustering coefficient>


EXAMPLE:

```


### greedy_routing
A tool to test the greedy routing on hyperbolic graphs.

```
NAME: 
greedy_routing -- compute the greedy routing success ratio 

SYNOPSIS: 
greedy_routing [parameters] 

DESCRIPTION:
The program loads in memory a hyperbolic graph (./graph.hg by default),
it simulates the greedy routing on a set of random source-destination node
pairs belonging to the same connected component (default is 10,000  random
pairs), and finally outputs the success ratio (i.e. the percentage of times
the information sent by the source node would have reached the destination
if each node would adopt the greedy routing rules.

PARAMETERS:
-i	    input graph file (in hg format)
        default value is ./graph.hg
-a	number of attempts
        default value is 10000
-s	random seed
        default value is 1
-h	print help menu

OUTPUT:
The program print the success ratio to standard output.

EXAMPLE:

# Test geometric greedy routing in the graph located in graph_example.hg
# using 20,000 random pairs of nodes.
# The seed for the random generator is 12345

greedy_routing -i graph_example.hg -a 20000 -s 12345
```

###  Installation FAQs:

**Where are the executables?**

By default, `make install` installs the package's commands under  `/usr/local/bin`, copies the header files under `/usr/local/include`, while the compiled libraries are available at `/usr/local/lib`. 
You can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local` by giving `configure` the option `--prefix=PREFIX`, where PREFIX must be an absolute path.


**Can I install the Hyperbolic Graph Generator in my HOME directory?**

Yes, all you need is to run `configure` using the `--prefix` option:
	```
   	./configure --prefix=/home/user/my_hg_generator
	```

Tools will be available in:

	`/home/user/my_hg_generator/bin`

Library files will be available in:

	`/home/user/my_hg_generator/include`

	`/home/user/my_hg_generator/lib`


**The boost libraries are not found, how can I fix this problem?**

If the boost libraries are not installed, then install them using your package management system, or:

   1) download them at http://www.boost.org/

   2) extract boost_xxx.tar.bz2 in a convenient location e.g. /home/user/

   Then run again the configure command in the Hyperbolic Graph Generator
   as follows:

```
        ./configure CPPFLAGS='-I/home/user/myboost'
```

   Note: boost are header-only libraries, no installation process is required


**The gsl libraries are not found, how can I fix this problem**

If the gsl libraries are not installed, then install them using your package management system or follow the instructions at http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/.


**My boost libraries are not installed in a standard path, how can I build the Hyperbolic Graph Generator?**

If the boost libraries are installed in a custom path, e.g. they are in `/home/user/myboost`, then the configure command must be run with the CPPFLAGS set:

```
	./configure CPPFLAGS='-I/home/user/myboost'
```

Boost are header-only libraries, then no LDFLAGS are required.


**My gsl libraries are not installed in a standard path, how can I install the Hyperbolic Graph Generator?**

If the gsl libraries are installed in a custom path, e.g.  they are in `/home/user/mygsl`, then the configure command must be run with both the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS set:

	```
	./configure CPPFLAGS='-I/home/user/mygsl/include' LDFLAGS="-L/home/user/mygsl/lib"
   	```	

If gsl are installed, the following command return the information to be put in the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS:

```
   $ gsl-config --cflags --libs
      -I/opt/local/include
      -L/opt/local/lib -lgsl -lgslcblas
```


**Both boost and gsl libraries are installed in non standard paths, how can I install the Hyperbolic Graph Generator?**

A combination of the previous answers can be used.

```
   ./configure CPPFLAGS='-I/home/user/myboost -I/home/user/mygsl/include' LDFLAGS="-L/home/user/mygsl/lib"
```

**error while loading shared libraries: libhggraphs.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory. How do I fix this problem?**

Run the following command (or put that line in your profile
   configuration file for your current shell, e.g. ~/.profile for Mac
   OS X,  ~/.bash_profile for FreeBSD, ~/.bash_rc for Ubuntu):

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

This works if your library is installed in /usr/local/lib. Otherwise,
substitute that with you lib installation directory.


**Is there a way to improve the speed of the library?**

It is possible to set a different optimization level at configuration
time, using the following option: 

```
   ./configure CXXLAGS='-O3'
```

The default optimization level is -O2.


**Can I use the hggraphs library to develop new tools?**

The libhggraphs public interface is described in the hg_graphs_lib.h file that is installed in `include/hg_graphs_lib.h`. In order to link the library to your tool you need to provide the -lhggraphs option as well as the path to the lib folder containing the library at linking time.
Let's suppose that the Hyperbolic Graph Generator installed in the default path `/usr/local`, in order to build a new tool the following operations have to be performed:

```
	g++ -I/usr/local/include -c my_new_tool.o my_new_tool.cpp
	g++ -o my_new_tool my_new_tool.o -L/usr/local/lib -lhggraphs
```
